# Protoype-Code

The Server is composed of 2 files: CincoTresServer and CincoTresProtocol. To run the server, place these two files in a seperate project from the client code. Then run the server project first, as a seperate program, and then run the client code.

The Client is composed of n files contained in "Libray Database" Folder. (name should be changed later to something like Client Program)
